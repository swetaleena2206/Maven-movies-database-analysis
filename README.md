# Maven-movies-database-analysis
THE SITUATION:
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business owner
who is interested in purchasing Maven Movies. He primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he
has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental business in general. His offer
seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions.

THE OBJECTIVE:
Use MySQL to:
•Access and explore the Maven Movies database
•Develop a firm grasp of the 16 database tables and how they relate to each other
•Analyze all aspects of the company’s data, including transactions, customers, staff, etc.
This will help answer your potential Acquirer’s questions.
