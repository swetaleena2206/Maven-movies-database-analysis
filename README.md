# Maven-movies-database-analysis
THE SITUATION
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business owner
who is interested in purchasing Maven Movies. He primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he
has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental business in general. His offer
seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions.

THE OBJECTIVE
Use MySQL to:
Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven
Movies database to answer your potential Acquirer’s questions.
